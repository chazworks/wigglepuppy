# WordPress to WigglePuppy Rebranding Tools

_This document was generated by JetBrains Junie_

## Overview

This directory contains tools for implementing the WordPress to WigglePuppy rebranding process as outlined in `/docs/plans/rebranding.md`. The rebranding process involves replacing instances of "WordPress" with "WigglePuppy" throughout the codebase while respecting specific caveats.

## Tools

### 1. Rebranding Inventory Generator

**File:** `rebranding-inventory.php`

This script analyzes the codebase to create a comprehensive inventory of "WordPress" instances that need to be rebranded to "WigglePuppy". It categorizes instances based on the caveats specified in the rebranding plan.

**Usage:**
```bash
php tools/rebranding-inventory.php
```

**Output:**
- Generates inventory files in `/docs/rebranding/`
- Creates a summary report at `/docs/rebranding/rebranding-summary.md`

### 2. Custom Rector Rules

**Directory:** `rector/src/Rebranding/`

Contains custom Rector rules for replacing "WordPress" with "WigglePuppy" in PHP files:

- `WordPressToWigglePuppyStringRector.php`: Replaces "WordPress" with "WigglePuppy" in string literals
- `WordPressToWigglePuppyCommentRector.php`: Replaces "WordPress" with "WigglePuppy" in comments

These rules are configured in the root `rector.php` file.

### 3. Non-PHP File Replacement Script

**File:** `rebranding-replace.php`

This script performs regex-based replacements of "WordPress" with "WigglePuppy" in non-PHP files (JS, HTML, CSS, etc.), following the caveats specified in the rebranding plan.

**Usage:**
```bash
php tools/rebranding-replace.php
```

**Output:**
- Modifies non-PHP files in-place
- Generates a log file at `/docs/rebranding/rebranding-replace-log.md`

### 4. Rebranding Execution Script

**File:** `rebranding-execute.php`

This is the main script that executes the entire rebranding process by running Rector for PHP files and the regex-based replacements for non-PHP files.

**Usage:**
```bash
php tools/rebranding-execute.php
```

**Process:**
1. Runs Rector in dry-run mode first for review
2. Prompts for confirmation before making actual changes
3. Runs Rector to process PHP files
4. Runs regex replacements for non-PHP files
5. Creates a completion report

**Output:**
- Modifies files in-place
- Generates a completion report at `/docs/rebranding/phase2-step1-completion.md`

## Rebranding Process

The complete rebranding process follows these steps:

1. **Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation**
   - Generate a comprehensive inventory using `rebranding-inventory.php`
   - Review the inventory to understand the scope of changes

2. **Phase 2: Implementation**
   - Step 1: Execute automated replacements using `rebranding-execute.php`
   - Step 2: Manually review and adjust any instances that were incorrectly changed or missed
   - Step 3: Update documentation to reflect the new branding

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Verification**
   - Run automated tests to ensure functionality is preserved
   - Manually inspect the application UI
   - Run validation checks to ensure no instances of "WordPress" remain (except those covered by caveats)

## Caveats

The rebranding process respects the following caveats:

1. Copyright notices and author attributions remain unchanged
2. Variable and function names containing "wordpress" remain unchanged
3. Filenames and URLs containing "wordpress" remain unchanged
4. References to WordPress as an organization remain unchanged
5. Casing is preserved during replacement (WordPress → WigglePuppy, wordpress → wigglepuppy, WORDPRESS → WIGGLEPUPPY)
6. Lines containing both "wordpress" and "wigglepuppy" remain unchanged

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the rebranding process:

1. Check the log files in `/docs/rebranding/` for details on what was changed
2. Review the Rector output for any errors or warnings
3. For specific files that weren't properly rebranded, manually inspect them and apply changes if necessary
4. If significant issues are discovered, consider using the rollback plan outlined in the rebranding document

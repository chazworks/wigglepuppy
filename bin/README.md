# WordPress Development Bash Scripts

_This document and all scripts mentioned herein were generated by Jetbrains Junie_

This directory contains bash scripts that perform the same tasks as the npm scripts in the project's package.json file, but without the nodejs dependency.

## Available Scripts

- `docker.sh`: A wrapper around the Docker Compose command that loads environment variables from the .env file and determines which Docker Compose files to use.
- `start.sh`: Starts the local development environment.
- `stop.sh`: Stops the local development environment.
- `restart.sh`: Restarts the local development environment.
- `clean.sh`: Stops the local development environment and removes volumes and orphaned containers.
- `reset.sh`: Stops the local development environment and removes all images, volumes, and orphaned containers.
- `install.sh`: Installs WordPress in the local development environment.
- `cli.sh`: Runs WP-CLI commands in the Docker environment.
- `logs.sh`: Shows the logs from the Docker containers.
- `pull.sh`: Pulls the Docker images used by the project.

## Usage

All scripts are executable and can be run directly from the command line. For example:

```bash
# Start the local development environment
./bin/start.sh

# Stop the local development environment
./bin/stop.sh

# Run a WP-CLI command
./bin/cli.sh plugin list

# Show the logs from the Docker containers
./bin/logs.sh
```

## Relationship to npm Scripts

These bash scripts are equivalent to the following npm scripts in package.json:

- `docker.sh`: Used by multiple npm scripts
- `start.sh`: `npm run env:start`
- `stop.sh`: `npm run env:stop`
- `restart.sh`: `npm run env:restart`
- `clean.sh`: `npm run env:clean`
- `reset.sh`: `npm run env:reset`
- `install.sh`: `npm run env:install`
- `cli.sh`: `npm run env:cli`
- `logs.sh`: `npm run env:logs`
- `pull.sh`: `npm run env:pull`

The advantage of these bash scripts is that they can be run without nodejs, making them more lightweight and portable.

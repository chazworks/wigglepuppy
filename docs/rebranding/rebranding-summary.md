## Replacement Strategy

### Instances to Change

The following instances should be changed from 'WordPress' to 'WigglePuppy' (preserving case):

- All instances categorized as 'changeable' in the detailed reports

### Instances to Preserve

The following instances should NOT be changed:

1. Copyright notices and author attributions
2. Variable names containing 'wordpress'
3. Function names containing 'wordpress'
4. Filenames and paths containing 'wordpress'
5. URLs containing 'wordpress'
6. References to WordPress as an organization
7. Lines containing both 'wordpress' and 'wigglepuppy'

### Implementation Approach

1. **Rector Rules**: For PHP files, custom Rector rules can be developed to handle the replacement of 'WordPress' with 'WigglePuppy' in string literals and comments, while respecting the caveats.

2. **Regex Search/Replace**: For non-PHP files (JS, HTML, CSS, etc.), regex-based search and replace scripts can be used.

3. **Visual Assets**: Visual assets will require manual replacement with new WigglePuppy designs.

_This document was generated by JetBrains Junie_

## Overview

This document reports the completion of Step 1 of Phase 1 of the WordPress to WigglePuppy rebranding plan, as specified in `/docs/plans/rebranding.md`.

## Completed Tasks

Step 1 of Phase 1 required creating a comprehensive inventory of all instances of "WordPress" in the codebase, categorizing them based on the specified caveats, and preparing for the implementation phase. The following tasks have been completed:

1. **Created a rebranding inventory generator script**:
   - Location: `/tools/rebranding-inventory.php`
   - Purpose: Analyzes the codebase to identify and categorize all instances of "WordPress"

2. **Generated a comprehensive inventory**:
   - Scanned 84,054 files with relevant extensions
   - Identified 11,709 files containing "WordPress"
   - Categorized 95,664 instances as "changeable" (should be replaced with "WigglePuppy")
   - Identified instances that should NOT be changed:
     - 309 copyright/author instances
     - 27 variable name instances
     - 446 function name instances
     - 1,241 filename/path instances
     - 3,933 URL instances
     - 94 organization reference instances
     - 54 co-occurrence instances
   - Identified 50 visual asset instances that will require manual replacement

3. **Created detailed reports and documentation**:
   - Summary report: `/docs/rebranding/rebranding-summary.md`
   - Mapping document: `/docs/rebranding/mapping-document.md`
   - Rector configuration guide: `/docs/rebranding/rector-configuration.md`
   - Detailed category reports (in `/docs/rebranding/`):
     - `allFiles.md`: List of all files containing "WordPress"
     - `changeableInstances.md`: Instances that should be changed
     - `copyrightInstances.md`: Copyright notices that should not be changed
     - `variableInstances.md`: Variable names that should not be changed
     - `functionInstances.md`: Function names that should not be changed
     - `filenameInstances.md`: Filenames and paths that should not be changed
     - `urlInstances.md`: URLs that should not be changed
     - `organizationInstances.md`: Organization references that should not be changed
     - `visualAssets.md`: Visual assets that need replacement
     - `coOccurrenceInstances.md`: Lines containing both "wordpress" and "wigglepuppy"

## Implementation Approach

Based on the analysis, the following implementation approach is recommended:

1. **PHP Files**: Use custom Rector rules to handle the replacement of "WordPress" with "WigglePuppy" in string literals, comments, and constants, while respecting the caveats.

2. **Non-PHP Files**: Use regex-based search and replace scripts for JS, HTML, CSS, and other file types.

3. **Visual Assets**: Manually replace visual assets with new WigglePuppy designs.

## Next Steps

The next steps in the rebranding process are:

1. **Phase 1, Step 2**: Develop test cases that verify the functionality before and after rebranding.

2. **Phase 2**: Implement the rebranding changes using the approach outlined above.

3. **Phase 3**: Test and verify the changes to ensure functionality is preserved.

4. **Phase 4**: Deploy the rebranded codebase.

## Conclusion

Step 1 of Phase 1 of the WordPress to WigglePuppy rebranding plan has been successfully completed. The comprehensive inventory and categorization provide a solid foundation for the implementation phase of the rebranding process.

# WordPress Development Project Guidelines for Junie

## Project Overview
This repository contains the WordPress development codebase. WordPress is a PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript based content management system that powers a significant portion of websites on the internet. This project follows specific development practices and workflows to maintain code quality and ensure proper functionality.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Contains the core WordPress source code
- `tests/` - Contains PHP unit tests and end-to-end tests
- `tools/` - Development and build tools
- `docs/` - Documentation files, including potential improvement tasks
- Configuration files:
  - PHP: `phpunit.xml.dist`, `phpcs.xml.dist`, `phpcompat.xml.dist`
  - JavaScript: `webpack.config.js`, `jsdoc.conf.json`, `Gruntfile.js`
  - Docker: `docker-compose.yml`
  - WordPress: `wp-config-sample.php`, `wp-tests-config-sample.php`

## Development Environment
The project uses Docker for local development. The environment can be set up using:
```
npm install
npm run build:dev
npm run env:start
npm run env:install
```

## Testing Requirements
When making changes to the codebase, Junie should:

1. Run appropriate tests to verify changes:
   - For PHP changes: `npm run test:php`
   - For end-to-end testing: `npm run test:e2e`
   - For specific PHP tests: `npm run test:php -- --filter <test name>` or `npm run test:php -- --group <group name or ticket number>`

2. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting changes.

3. Consider adding new tests for new functionality or bug fixes.

## Build Process
Before submitting changes, Junie should build the project:
- For development: `npm run build:dev`
- For production: `npm run build`

## Code Style Guidelines
The project follows WordPress coding standards:

1. PHP Code:
   - Follow [WordPress PHP Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)
   - Use proper documentation blocks for functions and classes

2. JavaScript Code:
   - Follow [WordPress JavaScript Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/javascript/)
   - Use modern JavaScript features supported by the build system

3. CSS/SCSS:
   - Follow [WordPress CSS Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/css/)

## Contribution Workflow
When working on tasks:

1. Understand the issue or feature request thoroughly
2. Make minimal, focused changes that address the specific issue
3. Run appropriate tests to verify changes
4. Build the project to ensure all assets are properly compiled
5. Provide clear documentation for any new functionality
6. Reference relevant documentation or tickets in commit messages

## Improvement Tasks
The repository includes a comprehensive list of potential improvement tasks in `docs/junie-tasks.md`. These tasks cover various aspects of the WordPress codebase including architecture, build system, testing, code quality, performance, security, user experience, documentation, and more.

When working on these tasks, Junie should prioritize:
- Maintaining backward compatibility
- Following WordPress coding standards
- Adding appropriate tests
- Providing clear documentation
